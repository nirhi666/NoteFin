- **Functionality:** The timer utilizes Python’s `datetime` library to track time and activate notes  
- **Testing:** The application has been manually tested across various scenarios, including scheduling accuracy, note management, and interface stability  

## Use Case & Future Development:
NoteFin is designed for users who value a **simple and efficient way to manage daily tasks**. Future development possibilities include:
- **Saving sticky notes to a database** for long-term use  
- **Customizing the UI with different themes and colors**
