# NoteFin 1.0 â€“ A Simple Sticky Note Activator for Daily Use  

NoteFin 1.0 is a **lightweight sticky note activator**, designed for users who need **quick reminders for the current day** without unnecessary clutter. It focuses on **simplicity and efficiency**, staying true to its original purpose â€“ **helping you remember, without extra features that go unused.**  

## Key Features:
âœ… **Smart scheduling** â€“ Just type a time (e.g., `14:30`), and the note will pop up automatically **5 minutes before**.  
âœ… **Minimalist note system** â€“ Designed for **same-day use** with no permanent saving or archiving.  
âœ… **Lightweight & distraction-free** â€“ No cloud, no background processes, just **quick, efficient reminders.**  

## What It Currently Does:
- **Only the activator window exists** â€“ No advanced features like cloud sync or task history.  
- **Notes reset daily** â€“ There is **no permanent storage** â€“ the app is meant for reminders you need **today, not tomorrow.**  
- **Basic timer function** â€“ Notes appear at the right time, but **there is no full task management system.**  

## Technical Implementation:
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **User Interface:** Tkinter (simple & responsive)  
- **Time tracking:** Uses Pythonâ€™s `datetime` library for scheduling  

## Future Development:
- **UI improvements (custom themes, resizing)**  
- **Better note management (optional settings, UI tweaks)**  
- **Additional features (if they align with the simple philosophy)**  

ðŸŽ¯ **NoteFin will remain a lightweight, no-nonsense reminder tool â€“ keeping things simple and efficient!**
